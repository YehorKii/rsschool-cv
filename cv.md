## About Me

I’m a frontend developer with a strong hands-on background and a deep theoretical foundation.
Proficient in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and modern responsive web development. Experienced in adaptive, cross-browser, semantic, and pixel-perfect layout with advanced animations.

I possess solid JavaScript knowledge — I’ve solved and analyzed a wide range of problems, including multiple implementations and performance measurements.
Confident working with React and TypeScript, implementing routing, and managing state with Redux and RTK Query.

I enjoy exploring language internals, and writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
